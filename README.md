# MateriaScout: An AI-Powered Materials Science Agent

This project is a submission for the **ðŸ¤– Gradio Agents & MCP Hackathon 2025 ðŸš€**.

You can find more information about the hackathon [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/gradio-hackathon-registration-2025).

## ðŸ’¡ Project Description

**MateriaScout** is an Agentic Demo Showcase designed for material scientists, researchers, and students. It provides a user-friendly, natural language interface to query the vast [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/) database.

Instead of writing complex API queries, users can simply ask questions like:

> "Find me materials made of Iron and Oxygen"

The agent parses this query, interacts with the Materials Project API, and returns the results in a clean, easy-to-read table.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Natural Language Queries:** No need to learn a complex query language.
*   **Dynamic Property Selection:** Choose from a comprehensive list of over 60 material properties to include in your results.
*   **Tabular Results:** View your data in a clear, organized table.
*   **Export to CSV:** Easily export your search results to a CSV file for further analysis.
*   **Powered by Gradio and FastAPI:** A modern, robust web framework for the UI and backend.
